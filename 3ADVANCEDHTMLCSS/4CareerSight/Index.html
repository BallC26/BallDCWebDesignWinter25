    <h1>Psychology: The Study of Human Behavior</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>Psychology is the study of why people do things and falls into the study of the human brain.</h2>
    <p>I am interested in this career because it explains why people act the way they do. I want to
        help people better themselves with therapy. I want to help people with anxiety and anger issues.
        Psychology combines studying the human brain and the human behavior. Genes affect how people act
        but environment also influences it.</p>
