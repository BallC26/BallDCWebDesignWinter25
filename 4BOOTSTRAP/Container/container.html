            <h2>What Is Bootstrap?</h2>
            <p>
                In the context of programming, "Bootstrap" refers to a popular CSS framework designed 
                to simplify the development of responsive and mobile-friendly websites and web applications. 
                It provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements that can be easily 
                incorporated into web pages to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

            <h2>How Is It Used?</h2>
            <p>
                Bootstrap simplifies responsive web development by providing
                 pre-designed templates, CSS styles, and JavaScript components. It allows developers to quickly
                  create websites and applications with a consistent and visually appealing interface, 
                  especially for mobile-first designs.

            <h2>Why Was It Made</h2>
            <p>
                Bootstrap was created to standardize and streamline front-end web development, 
                especially focusing on responsive design. It was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at 
                Twitter to address inconsistencies and high maintenance costs across internal tools. By providing 
                pre-styled components, a flexible grid system, and JavaScript plugins, Bootstrap aimed to make web development 
                faster and more efficient.
