            <h2>Life After Invention of the Smartphone</h2>
            <p>
                As smartphones became widespread, the constant stream of notifications, social media,
                 and instant messaging began to interrupt work. Attention spans decreased, and 
                 multitasking became the norm, reducing the quality and efficiency of work.

            <h2>How It Affected Us</h2>
            <p>
                Productivity was at an all time low with notific ations and calls going off every few minutes.
                the mobile phone allowed people to scroll on the internet whenever they wanted. They had everything
                they wanted in their pocket, which was too big of a distraction when it came to work and labor.

            <h2>Social Interactions After Smartphones</h2>
            <p>
                After the invention of smartphones, people started to interact less and be more self centered
                and shy. Social skills were at an all time low with more people being online and interacting
                more on screens than face to face.
