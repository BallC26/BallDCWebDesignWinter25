    <h3>Facts about Birds</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite parts of a bird is it's colors. Every bird has bright different colors
    and every different species has its own pattern of colors. Birds have many different variations of
    feathers for many reasons. A few could be Mating with a partner, Showing territory, communicating
    with other birds and hiding from predators. My favorite species of bird is the parrot. Known for
     their bright colors and smarts. Parrots can be found in a few places in the US as well as anywhere
    hot and tropical. Parrots can be found in places such as Texas, Florida, and San Fransisco mostly
  for their semi tropical environments and abundant fruit trees.</p>

    Another thing I love about Birds is how smart they are. Birds are considered to be among the most
    intelligent animals on planet Earth. Corvids (Crows, Jays, Magpies) and psittacines
     (Parrots, Cockatoos, Macaws) are considered to be the most intelligent type of birds, having high
     problem solving skills and cognative abilities. They're known to use "tools" to solve puzzles.
    Bent pieces of metal rods or certain shaped sticks to try and grab their food from places they can't
  reach. Birds are so intelligent because of the high density of neurons in their brains allowing for 
complex cognative abilities. They have a similar brain structure to the mammalian prefrontal cortex
which is very important for planning and sensory systems. This helps them navigate problems in their 
environment.</p> <br>
