            <h2>Before the Introduction of the Smartphone</h2>
            <p>
                Before mobile phones and especially smartphones, people worked with fewer distractions. 
                Communication was more intentional, and employees typically focused on tasks without 
                constant interruptions from calls, texts, or notifications.

            <h2>How Was Productivity Before Smartphones</h2>
            <p>
                Before smartphones, people were more productive and did more work. Smartphones offer 
                distractions from work and lower productivity. It was much higher with much more work being
                done in a day and mostly all work being accomplished without distractions.

            <h2>Social Interactions Before Smartphones</h2>
            <p>
                People were more interactive with eachother and talked to eachother more instead of being attached
                to a screen all day. Before their Introduction, phones were only made for calls to friends, family,
                or coworkers.
