                <h2>Viewing The Vaccuum of Space</h2>
                <p>For centuries, people have been viewing space through telescopes. The first Telescope was
                    created in 1608 when Dutch spectacle maker Hans Lippershey announced his invention to the world,
                    creating it for the purpose to "view far things as if they were close up". His invention led to
                    many breakthroughs in science and led to people making more powerful telescopes that could see
                    further such as the Hubble Telescope which can see 13.4 billion light years away, and the
                    James Webb telescope which can view 13.5 billion lightyears away.

                <h2>How Space was created</h2>
                <p>Many theories exist on how the universe came to be. Some say the Big Bang created the 
                    universe when a point of infinite density and infinte temperature exploded, leaving 
                    the universe behind. Many observations support this theory such as after glows from
                    the Big Bang when viewed from a telescope. Other theories suggest that God created the 
                    universe in 7 days, including light, day and night, humans, earth, space and everything in it.
                    Scientists are entirely sure exactly how the universe came to be.
